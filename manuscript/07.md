# Patterns for Custom Standalone APIs in Angular

Together with Standalone Components, the Angular team introduced Standalone APIs. They allow for setting up libraries in a more lightweight way. Examples of libraries currently providing Standalone APIs are the `HttpClient` and the `Router`. Also, NGRX is an early adopter of this idea.

In this chapter, I present several patterns for writing custom Standalone APIs inferred from the before mentioned libraries. For each pattern, the following aspects are discussed: intentions behind the pattern, description, example implementation, examples for occurrences in the mentioned libraries, and variations for implementation details.

Most of these patterns are especially interesting for library authors. They have the potential to improve the DX for the library's consumers. On the other side, most of them might be overkill for applications.

## Example

For presenting the inferred patterns, a simple logger library is used. This library is as simple as possible but as complex as needed to demonstrate the implementation of the patterns:

<img src="images/logger.png" style="max-width:300px">

Each log message has a `LogLevel`, defined by an enum:

```typescript
export enum LogLevel {
  DEBUG = 0,
  INFO = 1,
  ERROR = 2,
}
```

For the sake of simplicity, we restrict our Logger library to just three log levels. 

An abstract `LoggerConfig` defines the possible configuration options:

```typescript
export abstract class LoggerConfig {
  abstract level: LogLevel;
  abstract formatter: Type<LogFormatter>;
  abstract appenders: Type<LogAppender>[];
}
```

It's an abstract class on purpose, as interfaces cannot be used as tokens for DI. A constant of this class type defines the default values for the configuration options:

```typescript
export const defaultConfig: LoggerConfig = {
  level: LogLevel.DEBUG,
  formatter: DefaultLogFormatter,
  appenders: [DefaultLogAppender],
};
```

The `LogFormatter` is used for formatting log messages before they are published via a `LogAppender`:

```typescript
export abstract class LogFormatter {
  abstract format(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): string;
}
```

Like the `LoggerConfiguration`, the `LogFormatter` is an abstract class used as a token. The consumer of the logger lib can adjust the formatting by providing its own implementation. As an alternative, they can go with a default implementation provided by the lib:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DefaultLogFormatter implements LogFormatter {
  format(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): string {
    const levelString = LogLevel[level].padEnd(5);
    return `[${levelString}] ${category.toUpperCase()} ${msg}`;
  }
}
```

The `LogAppender` is another exchangeable concept responsible for appending the log message to a log:

```typescript
export abstract class LogAppender {
  abstract append(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): void;
}
```

The default implementation writes the message to the console:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DefaultLogAppender implements LogAppender {
  append(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): void {
    console.log(category + ' ' + msg);
  }
}
```

While there can only be one `LogFormatter`, the library supports several `LogAppenders`. For instance, a first `LogAppender` could write the message to the console while a second one could also send it to the server. 

To make this possible, the individual `LogAppender`s are registered via multi providers. Hence, the Injector returns all of them within an array. As an array cannot be used as a DI token, the example uses an `InjectionToken` instead:

```typescript
export const LOG_APPENDERS = new InjectionToken<LogAppender[]>("LOG_APPENDERS");
```

The `LoggserService` itself receives the `LoggerConfig`, the `LogFormatter`, and an array with `LogAppenders` via DI and allows to log messages for several `LogLevels`:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class LoggerService {
  private config = inject(LoggerConfig);
  private formatter = inject(LogFormatter);
  private appenders = inject(LOG_APPENDERS);

  log(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): void {
    if (level < this.config.level) {
      return;
    }
    const formatted = this.formatter.format(level, category, msg);
    for (const a of this.appenders) {
      a.append(level, category, formatted);
    }
  }

  error(category: string, msg: string): void {
    this.log(LogLevel.ERROR, category, msg);
  }

  info(category: string, msg: string): void {
    this.log(LogLevel.INFO, category, msg);
  }

  debug(category: string, msg: string): void {
    this.log(LogLevel.DEBUG, category, msg);
  }
}
```

## The Golden Rule

Before I start with presenting the inferred patterns, I want to stress out what I call the golden rule for providing services: 

> Whenever possible, use `@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})`!

Especially in application code but in several situations in libraries, this is what you want to have: It's easy, tree-shakable, and even works with lazy loading. The latter aspect is less a merit of Angular than the underlying bundler: Everything that is just needed in a lazy bundle is put there. 

## Pattern: Provider Factory

### Intentions

- Providing services for a reusable lib
- Configuring a reusable lib
- Exchanging defined implementation details

### Description

A Provider Factory is a function returning an array with providers for a given library. This Array is cross-casted into Angular's `EnvironmentProviders` type to make sure the providers can only be used in an environment scope -- first and foremost, the root scope and scopes introduced with lazy routing configurations.

Angular and NGRX place such functions in files called `provider.ts`.

### Example

The following Provider Function `provideLogger` takes a partial `LoggerConfiguration` and uses it to create some providers:

```typescript
export function provideLogger(
  config: Partial<LoggerConfig>
): EnvironmentProviders {
  // using default values for missing properties
  const merged = { ...defaultConfig, ...config };

  return makeEnvironmentProviders([
    {
      provide: LoggerConfig,
      useValue: merged,
    },
    {
      provide: LogFormatter,
      useClass: merged.formatter,
    },
    merged.appenders.map((a) => ({
      provide: LOG_APPENDERS,
      useClass: a,
      multi: true,
    })),
  ]);
}
```

Missing configuration values are taken from the default configuration. Angular's `makeEnvironmentProviders` wraps the `Provider` array in an instance of `EnvironmentProviders`.

This function allows the consuming application to setup the logger during bootstrapping like other libraries, e. g. the `HttpClient` or the `Router`:

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [

    provideHttpClient(),

    provideRouter(APP_ROUTES),

    [...]

    // Setting up the Logger:
    provideLogger(loggerConfig),
  ]
}
```

### Occurrences and Variations

- This is a usual pattern used in all examined libraries
- The Provider Factories for the `Router` and `HttpClient` have a second optional parameter that takes additional features (see Pattern _Feature_, below).
- Instead of passing in the concrete service implementation, e. g. LogFormatter, NGRX allows taking either a token or the concrete object for reducers.
- The `HttpClient` takes an array with functional interceptors via a `with` function (see Pattern _Feature_, below). These functions are also registered as services.

## Pattern: Feature

### Intentions

- Activating and configuring optional features
- Making these features tree-shakable
- Providing the underlying services via the current environment scope

### Description

The Provider Factory takes an optional array with a feature object. Each feature object has an identifier called `kind` and a `providers` array. The `kind` property allows for validating the combination of passed features. For instance, there might be mutually exclusive features like configuring XSRF token handling and disabling XSRF token handling for the `HttpClient`.

### Example

Our example uses a color feature that allows for displaying messages of different `LoggerLevel`s in different colors:

<img src="images/feature.png" style="max-width:300px">

For categorizing features, an enum is used:

```typescript
export enum LoggerFeatureKind {
    COLOR,
    OTHER_FEATURE,
    ADDITIONAL_FEATURE
}
```

Each feature is represented by an object of `LoggerFeature`:

```typescript
export interface LoggerFeature {
  kind: LoggerFeatureKind;
  providers: Provider[];
}
```

For providing the color feature, a factory function following the naming pattern with*Feature* is introduced:

```typescript
export function withColor(config?: Partial<ColorConfig>): LoggerFeature {
  const internal = { ...defaultColorConfig, ...config };

  return {
    kind: LoggerFeatureKind.COLOR,
    providers: [
      {
        provide: ColorConfig,
        useValue: internal,
      },
      {
        provide: ColorService,
        useClass: DefaultColorService,
      },
    ],
  };
}
```

The Provider Factory takes several features via an optional second parameter defined as a rest array:

```typescript
export function provideLogger(
  config: Partial<LoggerConfig>,
  ...features: LoggerFeature[]
): EnvironmentProviders {
  const merged = { ...defaultConfig, ...config };

  // Inspecting passed features
  const colorFeatures =
    features?.filter((f) => f.kind === LoggerFeatureKind.COLOR)?.length ?? 0;

  // Validating passed features
  if (colorFeatures > 1) {
    throw new Error("Only one color feature allowed for logger!");
  }

  return makeEnvironmentProviders([
    {
      provide: LoggerConfig,
      useValue: merged,
    },
    {
      provide: LogFormatter,
      useClass: merged.formatter,
    },
    merged.appenders.map((a) => ({
      provide: LOG_APPENDERS,
      useClass: a,
      multi: true,
    })),

    // Providing services for the features
    features?.map((f) => f.providers),
  ]);
}
```

The `kind` property of the feature is used to examine and validate the passed features. If everything is fine, the providers found in the feature are put into the returned `EnvironmentProviders` object.

The `DefaultLogAppender` gets hold of the `ColorService` provided by the color feature via dependency injection:

```typescript
export class DefaultLogAppender implements LogAppender {
  colorService = inject(ColorService, { optional: true });

  append(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): void {
    if (this.colorService) {
      msg = this.colorService.apply(level, msg);
    }
    console.log(msg);
  }
}
```

As features are optional, the `DefaultLogAppender` passes `optional: true` to `inject`. Otherwise, we would get an exception if the feature is not applied. Also, the `DefaultLogAppender` needs to check for `null` values.

### Occurrences and Variations

- The `Router` uses it, e. g. for configuring preloading or for activating debug tracing.
- The `HttpClient` uses it, e. g. for providing interceptors, configuring JSONP, and configuring/ disabling the XSRF token handling
- Both, the `Router` and the `HttpClient`, combine the possible features to a union type (e.g. `export type AllowedFeatures = ThisFeature | ThatFeature`). This helps IDEs to propose built-in features.
- Some implementations inject the current `Injector` and use it to find out which features have been configured. This is an imperative alternative to using `optional: true`.
- Angular's feature implementations prefix the properties `kind` and `providers` with `ɵ` and hence declare them as internal properties.

## Pattern: Configuration Provider Factory

### Intentions

- Configuring existing services
- Providing additional services and registering them with existing services
- Extending the behavior of a service from within a nested environment scope

### Description

Configuration Provider Factories extend the behavior of an existing service. They may provide additional services and use an `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` to get hold of instances of both the provided services as well as the existing services to extend.

### Example

Let's assume an extended version of our `LoggerService` that allows for defining an additional `LogAppender` for each log category:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class LoggerService {

    private appenders = inject(LOG_APPENDERS);
    private formatter = inject(LogFormatter);
    private config = inject(LoggerConfig);
    [...]

    // Additional LogAppender per log category
    readonly categories: Record<string, LogAppender> = {};

    log(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): void {
        
        if (level < this.config.level) {
            return;
        }

        const formatted = this.formatter.format(level, category, msg);

        // Lookup appender for this very category and use
        // it, if there is one:
        const catAppender = this.categories[category];

        if (catAppender) {
            catAppender.append(level, category, formatted);
        }

        // Also, use default appenders:
        for (const a of this.appenders) {
            a.append(level, category, formatted);
        }

    }

    [...]
}
```

To configurate a `LogAppender` for a category, we can introduce another Provider Factory:

```typescript
export function provideCategory(
  category: string,
  appender: Type<LogAppender>
): EnvironmentProviders {
  // Internal/ Local token for registering the service
  // and retrieving the resolved service instance
  // immediately after.
  const appenderToken = new InjectionToken<LogAppender>("APPENDER_" + category);

  return makeEnvironmentProviders([
    {
      provide: appenderToken,
      useClass: appender,
    },
    {
      provide: ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER,
      multi: true,
      useValue: () => {
        const appender = inject(appenderToken);
        const logger = inject(LoggerService);

        logger.categories[category] = appender;
      },
    },
  ]);
}
```

This factory creates a provider for the `LogAppender` class. However, we don't need the class but rather an instance of it. Also, we need the `Injector` to resolve this instance's dependencies. Both happen when retrieving a `LogAppender` via inject. 

Precisely this is done by the `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER`, which is multi provider bound to the token `ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER` and pointing to a function. It gets the `LogAppender` injected but also the `LoggerService`. Then, the `LogAppender` is registered with the logger. 

This allows for extending the existing `LoggerService` that can even come from a parent scope. For instance, the following example assumes the `LoggerService` in the root scope while the additional log category is setup in the scope of a lazy route:

```typescript
export const FLIGHT_BOOKING_ROUTES: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: FlightBookingComponent,

    // Providers for this route and child routes
    // Using the providers array sets up a new
    // environment injector for this part of the
    // application.
    providers: [
      // Setting up an NGRX feature slice
      provideState(bookingFeature),
      provideEffects([BookingEffects]),

      // Provide LogAppender for logger category
      provideCategory('booking', DefaultLogAppender),
    ],
    children: [
      {
        path: 'flight-search',
        component: FlightSearchComponent,
      },
      [...]
    ],
  },
];
```

### Occurrences and Variations

- `@ngrx/store` uses this pattern to register feature slices
- `@ngrx/effects` uses this pattern, to wire-up effects provided by a feature
- The feature `withDebugTracing` uses this pattern to subscribe to the `Router`'s `events` Observable.
  
## Pattern: NgModule Bridge

### Intentions

- Not breaking existing code using `NgModules` when switching to Standalone APIs.
- Allowing such application parts to set up `EnvironmentProviders` that come from a Provider Factory. 

Remarks: For new code, this pattern seems to be overkill, because the Provider Factory can be directly called for the consuming (legacy) NgModules. 

### Description

The NgModule Bridge is a NgModule deriving (some of) its providers via a Provider Factory (see pattern _Provider Factory_). To give the caller more control over the provided services, static methods like `forRoot` can be used. These methods can take a configuration object.

### Example

The following `NgModules` allows for setting up the Logger in a traditional way:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [/* your imports here */],
  exports: [/* your exports here */],
  declarations: [/* your delarations here */],
  providers: [/* providers, you _always_ want to get, here */],
})
export class LoggerModule {
  static forRoot(config = defaultConfig): ModuleWithProviders<LoggerModule> {
    return {
      ngModule: LoggerModule,
      providers: [
        provideLogger(config)
      ],
    };
  }

  static forCategory(
    category: string,
    appender: Type<LogAppender>
  ): ModuleWithProviders<LoggerModule> {
    return {
      ngModule: LoggerModule,
      providers: [
        provideCategory(category, appender)
      ],
    };
  }
}
```

To avoid reimplementing the Provider Factories, the Module's methods delegate to them. As using such methods is usual when working with NgModules, consumers can leverage existing knowledge and conventions.

### Occurrences and Variations

- All the examined libraries use this pattern to stay backwards compatible

## Pattern: Service Chain

### Intentions

- Making a service delegating to another instance of itself in a parent scope.

### Description

When the same service is placed in several nested environment injectors, we normally only get the service instance of the current scope. Hence, a call to the service in a nested scope is not respected in the parent scope. To work around this, a service can look up an instance of itself in the parent scope and delegate to it.

### Example

Let's assume we provide the logger library again for a lazy route:

```typescript
export const FLIGHT_BOOKING_ROUTES: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: FlightBookingComponent,
    canActivate: [() => inject(AuthService).isAuthenticated()],
    providers: [
      // NGRX
      provideState(bookingFeature),
      provideEffects([BookingEffects]),

      // Providing **another** logger for this part of the app:
      provideLogger(
        {
          level: LogLevel.DEBUG,
          chaining: true,
          appenders: [DefaultLogAppender],
        },
        withColor({
          debug: 42,
          error: 43,
          info: 46,
        })
      ),

    ],
    children: [
      {
        path: 'flight-search',
        component: FlightSearchComponent,
      },
      [...]
    ],
  },
];
```

This sets up **another** set of the Logger's services in the environment injector of this lazy route and its children. These services are shadowing their counterparts in the root scope. Hence, when a component in the lazy scope calls the `LoggerService`, the services in the root scope are not triggered.

To prevent this, we can get the `LoggerService` from the parent scope. More precisely, it's not _the_ parent scope but the "nearest ancestor scope" providing a `LoggerService`. After that, the service can delegate to its parent. This way, the services are chained:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class LoggerService {
  private appenders = inject(LOG_APPENDERS);
  private formatter = inject(LogFormatter);
  private config = inject(LoggerConfig);

  private parentLogger = inject(LoggerService, {
    optional: true,
    skipSelf: true,
  });
  [...]

  log(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): void {
   
    // 1. Do own stuff here
    [...]

    // 2. Delegate to parent
    if (this.config.chaining && this.parentLogger) {
        this.parentLogger.log(level, category, msg);
    }
  }
  [...]
}
```

When using inject to get hold of the parent's `LoggerService`, we need to pass the `optional: true` to avoid an exception if there is no ancestor scope with a `LoggerService`. Passing `skipSelf: true` makes sure, only ancestor scopes are searched. Otherwise, Angular would start with the current scope and retrieve the calling service itself.

Also, the example shown here allows activating/deactivating this behavior via a new `chaining` flag in the `LoggerConfiguration`.

### Occurrences and Variations

- The `HttpClient` uses this pattern to also trigger `HttpInterceptors` in parent scopes. More details on [chaining HttpInterceptors](https://www.angulararchitects.io/aktuelles/the-refurbished-httpclient-in-angular-15-standalone-apis-and-functional-interceptors/) can be found [here](https://www.angulararchitects.io/aktuelles/the-refurbished-httpclient-in-angular-15-standalone-apis-and-functional-interceptors/). Here, the chaining behavior can be activated via a separate feature. Technically, this feature registers another interceptor delegating to services in the parent scope.

## Pattern: Functional Service

### Intentions

- Making the usage of libraries more lightweight by using functions as services
- Reducing indirections by going with ad-hoc functions

### Description

Instead of forcing the consumer to implement a class-based service following a given interface, a library also accepts functions. Internally, they can be registered as a service using `useValue`.

### Example


In this example, the consumer can directly pass a function acting as a `LogFormatter` to `provideLogger`: 

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideLogger(
      {
        level: LogLevel.DEBUG,
        appenders: [DefaultLogAppender],

        // Functional CSV-Formatter
        formatter: (level, cat, msg) => [level, cat, msg].join(";"),
      },
      withColor({
        debug: 3,
      })
    ),
  ],
});
```

To allow for this, the Logger uses a `LogFormatFn` type defining the function's signature:

```typescript
export type LogFormatFn = (
  level: LogLevel,
  category: string,
  msg: string
) => string;
```

Also, as functions cannot be used as tokens, an `InjectionToken` is introduced:

```typescript
export const LOG_FORMATTER = new InjectionToken<LogFormatter | LogFormatFn>(
  "LOG_FORMATTER"
);
```

This `InjectionToken` supports both class-based `LogFormatter` as well as functional ones. This prevents breaking existing code. As a consequence of supporting both, `provideLogger` needs to treat both cases in a slightly different way: 

```typescript
export function provideLogger(config: Partial<LoggerConfig>, ...features: LoggerFeature[]): EnvironmentProviders {

    const merged = { ...defaultConfig, ...config};

    [...]

    return makeEnvironmentProviders([
        LoggerService,
        {
            provide: LoggerConfig,
            useValue: merged
        },

        // Register LogFormatter
        //  - Functional LogFormatter:  useValue
        //  - Class-based LogFormatters: useClass
        (typeof merged.formatter === 'function' ) ? {
            provide: LOG_FORMATTER,
            useValue: merged.formatter
        } : {
            provide: LOG_FORMATTER,
            useClass: merged.formatter
        },

        merged.appenders.map(a => ({
            provide: LOG_APPENDERS,
            useClass: a,
            multi: true
        })),
        [...]
    ]);
}
```

While class-based services are registered with `useClass`, `useValue` is the right choice for their functional counterparts.

Also, the consumers of the `LogFormatter` need to be prepared for both the functional as well as class-based approach:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class LoggerService {
  private appenders = inject(LOG_APPENDERS);
  private formatter = inject(LOG_FORMATTER);
  private config = inject(LoggerConfig);

  [...]

  private format(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): string {
    if (typeof this.formatter === 'function') {
        return this.formatter(level, category, msg);
    }
    else {
        return this.formatter.format(level, category, msg);
    }
  }

  log(level: LogLevel, category: string, msg: string): void {
    if (level < this.config.level) {
      return;
    }

    const formatted = this.format(level, category, msg);

    [...]
  }
  [...]
}
```

### Occurrences and Variations

- The `HttpClient` allows using functional interceptors. They are registered via a feature (see pattern _Feature_).
- The `Router` allows using functions for implementing guards and resolvers.


## Bonus: Aggregating Provider Factory

At the end, I want to present a pattern that is not found in the examined libraries. However, it has proven valuable in my daily work, as it allows combining libraries that haven't been built with each other in mind. This is similar to exporting several NgModules via one aggregating NgModule. 

### Intention

- Providing several libraries with one Provider Factory
- Making sure, libraries that are used together are correctly setup and wired up with each other

### Description

Provider Factories return an instance of EnvironmentProviders. Technically, this is a wrapper for a `Provider` array. The property holding this array is prefixed with `ɵ` and hence marked as internal. Hence, EnvironmentProviders becomes a black box for the application. Also, this makes sure that the providers can only be used for Environment Injectors like the root injector or the injector of a (lazy or not lazy) route. 

As the Providers array is internal, we cannot access it. This also prevents combining provider arrays coming from several libraries. To bypass this limitation, however, we can cross-cast EnvironmentProviders into a custom type mimicking the internal structure.

This pattern needs to be used carefully because it can lead to too many provided services. This, in turn, can influence tree-shakability. However, it also helps to hide implementation details from the consumer. For instance, when providing a library with the business logic for a given domain of your application, an Aggregating Provider Factory could set up the NGRX store, including a feature slice and reducers for the domain. The consumer of the domain library doesn't need to burden themselves with these technical aspects.

### Example

To mimic the `EnvironmentProviders` internal structure, we create a type called `InternalEnvironmentProviders`:

```typescript
type InternalEnvironmentProviders = {
  ɵproviders: Provider[];
};
```

When doing this, we need to understand that there are no guarantees for backwards compatibility of Angular's internal parts. Hence, we should limit the usage of `InternalEnvironmentProviders` to a minimum of well-maintained functions. 

In our case, the only function using `InternalEnvironmentProviders` is `combine`:

```typescript
export function combine(
  ep1: EnvironmentProviders,
  ep2: EnvironmentProviders
): EnvironmentProviders {

  // Never look into the sausage factory
  const internal1 = ep1 as unknown as InternalEnvironmentProviders;
  const internal2 = ep2 as unknown as InternalEnvironmentProviders;

  return makeEnvironmentProviders([
    ...internal1.ɵproviders,
    ...internal2.ɵproviders,
  ]);
}
```

This function takes two `EnvironmentProviders` instances and cross casts them into `InternalEnvironmentProviders`. From TypeScript's view point there is no relationship between these two types. Hence, TypeScripts type checks would prevent this case. To bypass this check, we need to cast to `unknown` first.

After this short but adventurous task, `combine` merges the providers together and wraps them up in another `EnvironmentProviders` object. 

Now, we can use `combine` for an Aggregating Provider Factory that returns both the providers for the Logger library as well as for another library:

```typescript
export function provideDiagnostics(): EnvironmentProviders {
  return combine(
    provideLogger({}, withColor()), 
    provideTimer()
  );
}
```

A more generic version of `combine` that allows merging an arbitrary amount of `EnvironmentProviders` instances could look like this:

```typescript
export function combineAll(
  ...ep: EnvironmentProviders[]
): EnvironmentProviders {
  const internal = ep as unknown as InternalEnvironmentProviders[];

  return makeEnvironmentProviders([
    internal.reduce(
      (acc: Provider[], p: InternalEnvironmentProviders) => [
        ...acc,
        p.ɵproviders,
      ],
      []
    ),
  ]);
}
```

Now, for providing all the combined libraries, only one call is needed:

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    [...]
    provideDiagnostics(),
  ]
}
```
